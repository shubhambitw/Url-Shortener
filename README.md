# Url-Shortener
A sample URL shortener using Python Flask.

To install and run, make sure you have Python 3 installed. You will also need Flask (pip install requirements.txt). Then just run the program from a console of your liking (python main.py).

This starts the service in debug mode on localhost:5000. A more production-like setup is beyond this scope.
